  'article': 'In certain forests, when you look up you will see a network of cracks formed by gaps between the \noutermost edges of tree branches. It looks like a precisely engineered jigsaw puzzle, each branch growing \njust perfectly so it almost,   11  , touches the  neighboring tree . This beautiful phenomenon is called \ncrown shyness .   \nScientists have been discussing crown shyness since the 1920s, proposing   12   explanations for \nthe phenomenon. Some researchers point out that as trees often grow close together, treetops  can easily \ncollide and break when swayed by the wind. In order to protect their branches from breakage , trees maintain \n“shyness gaps” —spaces large enough to prevent them from touching their neighbors .  \nOther scientists suggest that plants, like animals,   13   resources —nutrients, water, space, and \nlight. In forested areas with thick tree crowns, there is intense struggle for these resources. Gaps in the \ntreetops resulting from crown shyness may allow trees to increase their   14   light and enhance \nphoto synthesis.  Additionally, by having branches that do not touch those of their neighbors, trees may be \nable to limit the spread of leaf -eating insects, and potentially also the transmission of diseases from tree to \ntree.   15   decades of investigation, ther e is no consensus on exactly what causes the beautiful and \nmysterious phenomenon of crown shyness .',
